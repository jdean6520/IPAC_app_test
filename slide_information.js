			title: "1.3 About IPAC-UH60M",
			transcript: 'Modern helicopters perform a wide variety of challenging missions with truly dynamic operational parameters. The IPAC-UH60M program suite integrates performance planning and mission planning data into a single interface, eliminating calculation errors, minimizing mistakes, and enabling air crews to quickly recalculate performance planning values by changing one or more parameters to achieve an optimal flight performance profile.',

			title: "1.4 What You Will Learn",
			transcript: 'It is important for you to have an understanding of aircraft performance planning in order to successfully operate IPAC-UH60M. You can use this software to create and save aircraft configuration data, making it easier and more efficient to prepare a Performance Planning Card, or PPC. This course gives you a basic understanding of the IPAC program suite and teaches you how to use this software to prepare a PPC for the UH-60M. <br /> IPAC automates the preparation of the Black Hawk PPC as well as the weight and balance 365-4 [three sixty five dash four] Transport Form F by allowing the air crew mission planner to edit aircraft performance and configuration data either inside the Portable Flight Planning Software, or PFPS, or in a standalone capacity.',

		{title: "2.4 Configuring the Basic Aircraft Items",
		transcript: "Now, let’s configure the basic aircraft items. We’ll perform these actions on the Operating Aircraft Configuration dialog by entering and verifying data on the available tabs.<br />For the purposes of this training, enter and verify the necessary data on the General tab.<br />Verify 2412 in the Internal fuel capacity field for the main fuel system.<br />Enter 2680 in the External fuel capacity field.<br />Enter 9406487 in the Aircraft serial number field.<br />Verify that the MDS field contains UH-60L for the aircraft type.<br />Enter 11523 in the Basic weight field.<br />Enter 840 in the Fixed operating items weight field for the Crew and Crew Baggage weight.<br />Enter 688 in the Jettison operating items weight field, which is the weight of two empty CEFS tanks.<br />Now, let’s set the Aircraft Configuration tab. Click the tab to display it, and then enter or verify the required data.<br />Select Installed from the EIBF drop-down list.<br />Enter .95 in the Engine #1 Torque Factor field.<br />Verify 1.000 in the Engine #2 Torque Factor field.<br />Select 701D/CC from the Engine Type drop-down list.<br />Select Installed from the ESSS drop-down list.<br />Click the Drag Only Items tab to display it, and then select or verify the installed equipment.<br />For this exercise:<br />Select Total System for CMWS.<br />Select Installed for Electro-Optic Missile Sensors Fifth Sensor.<br />Finally, let’s define any Custom Configuration Items. Click Items… on the Drag Only Items tab. Here you can check boxes as needed for custom items, and enter data for all fields for each item checked when preparing a PPC.<br />For this exercise:<br />Check the box before Custom Item #1.<br />Enter Test SATCOM Antenna in the Name field.<br />Enter .44 in the Drag field.<br />Enter .001 in the Download field.<br />Check the box before Custom Item #2.<br />Enter 2 CEFS Tanks in the Name field.<br />Enter -1.70 in the Drag field.<br />Enter -0.011 in the Download field.<br />These are our only Custom Items to enter in this scenario, so we can click OK to close the dialog.<br /><br />Click Close to close the Operating Aircraft Configuration dialog.<br />To use the data input in the Operating Aircraft Configuration dialog for future performance planning sessions, let’s export the aircraft configuration data we have just created.<br />Select File, then Aircraft Configuration (ACFG), then Export Aircraft Configuration.<br />Choose the Windows desktop as your file location.<br />Name the file 9406487.<br />Select Save and then click OK.",
