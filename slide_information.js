		{title: "1.3 About IPAC-UH60M",
		transcript: 'Modern helicopters perform a wide variety of challenging missions with truly dynamic operational parameters. The IPAC-UH60M program suite integrates performance planning and mission planning data into a single interface, eliminating calculation errors, minimizing mistakes, and enabling air crews to quickly recalculate performance planning values by changing one or more parameters to achieve an optimal flight performance profile.',

		{title: "1.4 What You Will Learn",
		transcript: 'It is important for you to have an understanding of aircraft performance planning in order to successfully operate IPAC-UH60M. You can use this software to create and save aircraft configuration data, making it easier and more efficient to prepare a Performance Planning Card, or PPC. This course gives you a basic understanding of the IPAC program suite and teaches you how to use this software to prepare a PPC for the UH-60M. <br /> IPAC automates the preparation of the Black Hawk PPC as well as the weight and balance 365-4 [three sixty five dash four] Transport Form F by allowing the air crew mission planner to edit aircraft performance and configuration data either inside the Portable Flight Planning Software, or PFPS, or in a standalone capacity.',

		{title: "1.5 The IPAC-UH60M Applications",
		transcript: 'The IPAC-UH60M suite consists of three applications. Two of these applications allow you to print a PPC. They include:<br />PPC-UH60M, which allows you to print a PPC without opening PFPS. <br />IPAC-UH60M, which integrates with PFPS applications, such as Combat Flight Planning Software (or CFPS) and FalconView, to provide aircraft configuration and flight performance inputs with PFPS. This application allows you to print the PPC from data in the planned PFPS route. <br />The third application, AFF-UH60M, is a standalone application that allows you to view and edit detailed aircraft configuration data, and generate a Transport Form F.',
